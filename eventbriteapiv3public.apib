# Eventbrite API V3

## Quick Start
The Eventbrite API is REST-based (though we generally use POST rather than PUT), uses OAuth2 for authentication, and always returns responses in JSON.<br />

All you’ll need to interact with the API are your favourite HTTP library and a JSON parser - in the examples below, we’ll be using Python with the <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests" target="_blank">requests</a> library.

## Authentication

The Eventbrite API uses OAuth2 for authentication; while it’s a reasonably simple protocol, it’s also not very strongly specified, so make sure you read the documentation below to make sure you’re using it correctly.

OAuth authorize URL:  
`https://www.eventbrite.com/oauth/authorize`

OAuth access token URL:  
`https://www.eventbrite.com/oauth/token`

### Getting a Token

All API requests must be authenticated with a valid OAuth token. Tokens are tied to user accounts; if you’re just using the API for a single user or organizer, then follow Personal Tokens; if you’re using the API for many Eventbrite users, then follow OAuth Token Flow.

<b>Personal Tokens</b>  
As many of our API users are just doing an integration for a single user or organizer, we have a streamlined workflow for users to get an OAuth token just to represent themselves.

All you need to do is visit your apps page, and make sure you have at least one app created. Every app you own will have a <em>"Your OAuth Token"</em> entry; click <em>Show</em> on that to reveal a premade OAuth token for your account.

<b>OAuth Token Flow</b>  
If you’re accessing the API on behalf of users other than yourself - for example, if you’re a service building on top of Eventbrite - you’ll need to do the full OAuth token flow for each user that you want to access us on behalf of.

Visually, the users will go from your website or application to our website, confirm that they want to allow access to your application, and then we’ll redirect back to you with a token you can store and use to access the API on their behalf.

Sometimes, the tokens may expire (for example, if the user changes their password); in this case, you’ll get an error back that the token is invalid and you should direct the user through the flow once again. If a user still has your app approved, we’ll just redirect back to you immediately with a new token, skipping the approval screen.

To authenticate users via the API, you’ll need the following details (available in the apps management page located in your account settings):

<b>App Key:</b> Identifies your app during the OAuth handshake. Not secret.  
<b>Client Secret:</b> Identifies your app during a server-side handshake. Secret.  
<b>Redirect URI:</b> The URI we’ll redirect users to once they approve your app. You need to set this in the Eventbrite app settings.

<b>Client-side flow</b>  
To authenticate a user from a client-side (JavaScript) application, simply redirect your users to the following url:

`https://www.eventbrite.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=YOUR_APP_KEY&redirect_uri=YOUR_URL`

The user be redirected to an Approve/Deny page on Eventbrite. When they select either option, they’ll be redirected back to the Redirect URI you set; if they select “approve”, there will also be an OAuth token in the hash fragment of the URL.

<b>Server-side flow</b>  
To authenticate a user from a server-side application, first redirect them to our authorization URL:

`https://www.eventbrite.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_APP_KEY`

The user will see an <b>Approve/Deny</b> page. When they hit either option, they’ll be redirected back to your Redirect URI; if they hit Approve, then there will be a code query parameter on the end of the URL representing an access code.

You must then exchange this access code for an OAuth token. Send a `POST` request to:
`https://www.eventbrite.com/oauth/token`

This `POST` must contain the following urlencoded data, along with a Content-type: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded header:`

<pre><code>code=THE_USERS_AUTH_CODE&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&client_id=YOUR_API_KEY&grant_type=authorization_code</pre></code>

The subsequent `POST` will contain the user’s access_token.

<b>Authenticating requests</b>  
Once you have an OAuth token, you must include it on all requests - every request to the OAuth API must be authenticated, no anonymous access is allowed.

You have two options to pass the token: using the authentication header (preferred) or as a query string parameter

<b>Authorization header</b>  
Just include an Authorization header with the value Bearer MYTOKEN:

`Authorization: Bearer SESXYS4X3FJ5LHZRWGKQ`

<b>Query string parameter</b>  
Include the token on the end of the URL as the token parameter:

`https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/users/me/?token=SESXYS4X3FJ5LHZRWGKQ`

## Errors

When an error occurs during an API request, you’ll get a response with an error HTTP status (in the 400 or 500 range), as well as a JSON response containing more information about the error.

A typical error response looks like this:
<pre><code>
{
    "error": "VENUE_AND_ONLINE",
    "error_description": "You cannot both specify a venue and set online_event",
    "status_code": 400
}
</code></pre>

The error key contains a constant string value for error - in this case, `VENUE_AND_ONLINE` - and is what you should key your error handling off of, as this string won’t change depending on locale or as we change the API over time.

The error_description key is for developer information only and will usually contain a more informative explanation for the error, should you be confused. You should not display this string to your users; it’s often very technical and may not be localized to their language.

The status_code value just mirrors the HTTP status code you got as part of the request. It’s there as a convenience if your HTTP library makes it very hard to get status codes, or has one error handler for all error codes.

### Common Errors

You can find a listing of the individual errors for each endpoint on their endpoint entries, but there are also some common errors that all endpoints might return:

- **NOT_FOUND:** The URL you gave is not valid. Status code 404.
- **INVALID_AUTH:** Your authentication (usually OAuth token) is incorrect. Status code 400.
- **INVALID_AUTH_HEADER:** Your Authentication header is malformed. Status code 400.
- **NO_AUTH:** You did not provide any authentication at all. Status code 401.
- **BAD_PAGE:** The page number you gave does not exist or makes no sense (e.g. negative). Status code 400.
- **NOT_AUTHORIZED:** The user you are connecting as is not allowed to view/perform that action. Status code 403.
- **METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED:** You sent a method to the endpoint it can’t handle (e.g. DELETE to a GET-only endpoint). Status code 405.
- **HIT_RATE_LIMIT:** You have hit your hourly rate limit for this token to the API. Default rate limits are set to 1,000 calls per hour. Status code 429.
- **INTERNAL_ERROR:** An unhandled error occured in Eventbrite. Contact developer support if this persists. Status code 500.
- **EXPANSION_FAILED:** There was an unhandled error trying to expand one of the specified expansions; the request is likely to succeed if you don’t ask for expansions, but contact developer support if this persists. Status code 500.
- **INVALID_BATCH:** Your batched request was malformed or missing. Status code 400.

## Paginated Responses

All API endpoints which return multiple objects will return paginated responses; as well as the list of objects (which will usually be under a key like events or attendees, depending on the endpoint) there will also be a pagination key:
<pre><code>{
    "pagination": {
        "object_count": 13,
        "page_number": 2,
        "page_size": 50,
        "page_count": 2,
        "continuation": "dGhpcyBpcyBhIGNvbnRpbnVhdGlvbiB0b2tlbg"
    },
    "events": [
        ...
    ]
}
</code></pre>
This pagination key gives you information about the number of pages in the result, and how many objects are returned:

- **page_number:** The current page number <em>(starts at 1)</em>
- **page_size:** The number of objects on each page <em>(roughly)</em>
- **object_count:** The total number of objects across all pages <em>(optional)</em>
- **page_count:** The total number of pages <em>(starting at 1) (optional)</em>
- **continuation:** A token to return to the server to get the next set of results <em>(see “Continuated Responses” below)</em>

You can specify the page number you would like to request using the page parameter. However, page sizes are fixed, usually around 50 objects per page, but it may be smaller or larger depending on the particular endpoint (the sizes are tuned to improve API response speed and cacheability).

In addition, you’re not guaranteed to get back the given number of items per page; you may get more or less depending on pagination backend optimizations. It should be treated as a rough guide.

> <h4>Note</h4> that while we guarantee stable ordering of objects in paginated resources, the objects being returned may change between requests (e.g. the orders endpoint for a fast-selling event; between requesting page 1 and page 2, more items may have appeared on or been removed from page 1).

These endpoints will usually have an alternative way of querying without missing objects, however, often based off of modified times. See the individual endpoint pages for details.

Also note that on some endpoints, you won’t get back object_count and page_count, and you’re expected to just keep incrementing the page number until you get the BAD_PAGE error or you have enough data. These endpoints typically have a very large number of results (for example, the endpoint that lists every event on Eventbrite), and calculating the exact count would take too long.



### Continuated Responses

In addition to standard pagination, some endpoints will also include continuation tokens. A continuation token is a string returned by the server that the client is expected to include in the next request to get the next page of results. In lieu of, or in addition to, the pagination items listed above, the following keys will be added to the pagination key in the response:

continuation: a string containing the continuation token
has_more_items: a boolean indicating if the next request will contain any results
The intended way to use continuation tokens is:

Make an initial request to an endpoint.
Store the token returned by the server, and include it in the next request
When all records have been retrieved, the continuation key will not be present in the response.
For example, if the response for your initial request to the /v3/example/ endpoint looks like this:
<pre><code>{
    "pagination": {
        ...
        "continuation": "dGhpcyBpcyBwYWdlIDE",
        "has_more_items": true
    },
    "events": [
        ...
    ]
}

Then to receive the next page of the results for that endpoint, you would make a request to /v3/example/?continuation=dGhpcyBpcyBwYWdlIDE, which may yield a response like this:

{
    "pagination": {
        ...
        "has_more_items": false
    },
    "events": []
}
</code></pre>

In this case, there is no continuation key, so there are no more results. The next request can be made without a continuation token to get new results.

In addition to continuation, we also include a has_more_items key to indicate to the client whether a subsequent request will yield any results. This is a convenience for the client, and subsequent requests would return no results.
## Expansions

Eventbrite has many models that refer to each other, and often you’ll want to fetch related data along with the primary model you’re querying - for example, you’ll want to fetch an organizer along with each event you get back.

The way of doing this in the Eventbrite API is called **‘expansions’**: you can specify a list of relationships to additionally fetch with every call.

The available expansions are based on the type of object you’re being returned; each of the return formats lists available expansions, as you can see in the event and attendee documentation, for example.

To ask for an expansion, just pass a comma-separated list of expansion names as the expand querystring argument in your URL.

<em>For example, to fetch all my own events with organizers and venues expanded:</em>

`/v3/users/me/owned_events/?expand=organizer,venue`

Note that each expansion you specify will slow down your API request slightly, so try to use as few as possible to ensure faster response times.

### Nested expansions

Sometimes you might want to expand the attributes of an object that has itself been returned by an expansion.

<em>For example, you may have a list of orders and want to retrieve the event for each of those orders and the venue for each of those events:</em>

`/v3/users/me/orders/?expand=event.venue`

Expansions can be nested in this way **up to four levels deep**.
## Batched Requests

To save on the added latency of doing several API requests at once - especially in high-latency environments like mobile data - it’s possible to do a batched request to the API and have our servers process all of your requests at once, saving you the cost of several request round trips.

> <h4>Note</h4>Batched requests currently execute serially on our servers, rather than in parallel, so they are not suitable for speeding up a set of very slow operations, but are much better for a large volume of quick operations.

To do a batched request, you can send a JSON-formatted list of your requests to the /batch/ endpoint using POST, as the POST parameter batch:

<code>[  
    {"method":"GET", "relative_url":"users/me"},  
    {"method":"GET", "relative_url":"users/me/owned_events/"},  
    {"method":"GET", "relative_url":"users/me/owned_events/?page=2"}  
]</code>


You can also send application/json as content-type by passing a double encoded JSON object:


<pre><code>{ "batch":  
"[{\"method\":\"GET\", \"relative_url\":\"users/me/\"},  
{\"method\":\"GET\", \"relative_url\":\"users/me/owned_events/\"},  
{\"method\":\"GET\", \"relative_url\":\"users/me/owned_events/?page=2\"}]"  
}</code></pre>

And can pass request bodies (for e.g. POST data):

<pre><code>[  
    {"method":"POST", "relative_url":"events/", "body":"event.name.html=Test&event.organizer_id=34"},  
]</code></pre>

> <h4>Warning</h4> POST support is not yet complete, and will not pass any parameters. This documentation is here for future reference.

This results in a JSON formatted response, with one response entry for each request you submitted:
<pre><code>[
    {
        "body": "{\"emails\": [{\"email\": \"andrewgodwin@evbqa.com\", \"verified\": false, \"primary\": true}], \"id\": \"106645007774\", \"name\": \"andrewgodwin@evbqa.com\", \"first_name\": null, \"last_name\": null}",
        "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
            "Vary": "Accept",
            "Allow": "GET, HEAD, OPTIONS"
        },
        "code": 200
    },
    {
        "body": "{\"pagination\": {...}, \"events\": [...]}",
        "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
            "Vary": "Accept",
            "Allow": "GET, HEAD, OPTIONS"
        },
        "code": 200
    },
    {
        "body": "{\"status_code\": 400, \"error_description\": \"You passed an invalid page number.\", \"error\": \"BAD_PAGE\"}",
        "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
            "Vary": "Accept",
            "Allow": "GET, HEAD, OPTIONS"
        },
        "code": 400
    }
]</code></pre>

### A response has three keys:  
    **Body,** which is a string containing the HTTP body of the request.  
    **Headers,** a dictionary/object containing the HTTP headers of the response.  
    **Code,** an integer containing the HTTP status code of the response.  

> Notably, the response body will need additional decoding by your client before it can be parsed (it is not just broken out as separate JSON as it might contain different kinds of response data).  

Errors will appear in the JSON responses
<pre><code>{
    "body": "{\"status_code\": 400, \"error_description\": \"You passed an invalid page number.\", \"error\": \"BAD_PAGE\"}",
    "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
        "Vary": "Accept",
        "Allow": "GET, HEAD, OPTIONS"
    },
    "code": 400
}</pre></code>
you can see above this response has a `400` error code and is defined as a `BAD_PAGE` error  
> Most of the time `POST /batch/` will always return with a code of `200`.

## API Switches

### What do switches do?

Switches allow for the dynamic modification of Eventbrite API endpoint behaviors. They can be used to enable new or experimental features, change response formats, and other behaviors. In general, switches are used to ease the process of phasing in new API features that would otherwise break clients. Clients may activate or deactivate switchable features by setting switch headers on API requests.

### Switch lifecycle

A feature and its switch go through three phases:

- Opt-in, in which a new switch will be available to turn on the new feature.
- Opt-out, in which the feature will be on by default and the switch will be available to turn it off.
- Fully integrated, at which time the switch will be deprecated.

> Eventbrite will notify all API consumers before any switchable feature is introduced or enters a new phase.

### Public and protected switches

Switches may be exposed only to certain clients, at Eventbrite’s discretion. Such switches will be restricted to a set of whitelisted API keys, and any client attempting to set a protected switch using a non-whitelisted API key will get a permission error.

Switches that are not protected are available to be used by any client.

### Using switches

#### Making a request using switch headers
Clients use request headers to set switches on API requests. A switch header may contain any number of switch names, separated by commas. Switch names consist of letters, numbers and underscores, and are case-insensitive.

To use the example of a switch called “EVENT_FORMAT_OCT_2016” that activates a new Event serialization format:
<pre><code>GET /v3/events/12345/ Eb-Api-Switches-Enabled: EVENT_FORMAT_OCT_2016
This call will return the event with ID 12345 using the new format.</code></pre>

If the same switch were opt-out, and the client needed to make a request using the old Event format, it would deactivate the switch like so:

<pre><code>GET /v3/events/12345/ Eb-Api-Switches-Disabled: EVENT_FORMAT_OCT_2016
This call would return the event using the old format.</code></pre>

### Errors

A request containing switch headers may return the following error codes:

**409 REQUEST_CONFLICT:** Conflicting switches were passed. This happens if the client passes the same switch in both the Enabled and Disabled headers.
**403 NOT_AUTHORIZED:** The client sent a header for a switch that it is not allowed to set.
**400 BAD_REQUEST:** The client sent a header for a switch that does not exist or has been deprecated.
## Basic Types

### Integer

`10`

A standard JSON integer.

### Boolean

`true`

A standard JSON boolean.

### String

`"Ihre Aal ist r\u00fcckw\u00e4rts"`

A standard JSON string.

(When POSTing data as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, use a UTF-8
encoded string instead rather than unicode escapes)

### Float

`72.19381730`

A standard JSON floating-point decimal.

### Decimal

`"72.19381730"`

An arbitrary-precision decimal number encoded as a standard JSON string. Decimals are used in cases where
floating-point arithmetic inaccuracies could arise with standard JSON floating-point decimals.

### Date

`"2010-01-31"`

A date represented as a string in ISO8601 date format.

### Datetime

`"2010-01-31T13:00:00Z"`

A datetime represented as a string in ISO8601 combined date and time format,
always in UTC.

### Local Datetime

`"2010-01-31T13:00:00"`

A datetime represented as a string in Naive Local ISO8601 date and time format,
in the timezone of the event.

### Datetime with Timezone

<pre><code>{
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
    "utc": "2018-05-12T02:00:00Z",
    "local": "2018-05-11T19:00:00"
}
</code></pre>

A combination of a timezone from the Olson specification as a :format:`string`,
and two :format:`datetime` values, one for the UTC time represented and one
for the local time in the named timezone.

When being sent as input, only `utc` and `timezone` are required; `local`
is ignored.

This value is only used for fields where the timezone itself is important
information - for example, event start times.

### List

<pre><code>[1, 2, 3, 4]
"1,2,3,4"
</code></pre>

A list of literal values. With a content-type of `application/json`, it
should be a JSON array of literals, otherwise, for
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` it should be a string than is a comma
separated list of values.

### Object List

<pre><code>[{"name1": "val1", "name2": "val2"}, {...}]
"[{\"name1\": \"val1\", \"name2\": \"val2\"}, {...}]"
</code></pre>

A JSON list of object values. With a content-type of `application/json`, it
should be a JSON array, otherwise, for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
it should be a string encoding of a JSON array.

### Dictionary

<pre><code>{"key1": "value1", "key2": {"objectkey": "value"}, "key3": [list_values], {...}}
"{\"key2\": {\"key3\": \"value\"}, \"key1\": \"value\", \"key4\": [\"value\", \"value\"]}"
</code></pre>

A JSON object representation of a dictionary. With a content-type of
`application/json`, it should be a JSON object, otherwise, for
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` it should be a string encoding
of a JSON object.

### Multipart Text

<pre><code>{
    "text": "Event Name",
    "html": "<b>Event</b> Name",
}
</code></pre>

Returned for fields which represent HTML, like event names
and descriptions.

The `html` key represents the original HTML (which _should_
be sanitized and free from injected script tags etc., but as always, be careful
what you put in your DOM), while the `text` key is a stripped version useful
for places where you can't or don't need to display the full HTML version.

### Country Code

`"AR"`

The ISO 3166 alpha-2 code of a country.

### Currency Code

`"USD"`

An ISO 4217 3-character code of a currency

### Currency

<pre><code>{
    "currency": "USD",
    "value": 432,
    "major_value": "4.32",
    "display": "4.32 USD"
}
</code></pre>

When submitting as form-encoded POST data, you can instead provide a string
indicating the currency and the value separated by a comma, e.g. `USD,432` -
however, when you submit a JSON POST body, you must submit this as a JSON
object with the `currency` and `value` fields.

Returned for monetary values, such as ticket prices, fees charged and
tax amounts.

Currencies are represented as their currency code and an integer value,
where the code is the currency code as defined by
`ISO 4217 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217>`\_ and the integer value
is the number of units of the minor unit of the currency (e.g. cents for
US dollars).

You can get a value in the currency's major unit - for example, dollars
or pound sterling - by taking the integer value provided and shifting the
decimal point left by the exponent value for that currency as defined in
`ISO 4217 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217>`\_.

For example, the exponent for USD (the US dollar) is 2, so a value of
`2311` becomes `$23.11`. For JPY (the Japanese yen) it's 0, so
a value of `2311` becomes `¥2311`.

Eventbrite does not currently sell tickets in non-decimal currencies,
such as the Malagasy ariary (MGA), but any value for them would also be
returned in minor units (for example, `("MGA", 7)` would mean 1.2 MGA,
or 1 ariary and 2 francs).

The `display` value is provided for your convenience; its formatting
may change depending on the locale you query the API with (for example,
commas for decimal separators in European locales).

### Address

<pre><code>{
    "address_1": "333 O'Farrell St",
    "address_2": "Suite 400",
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "region": "CA",
    "postal_code": "94102",
    "country": "US",
    "latitude": "37.7576792",
    "longitude": "-122.5078119",
    "localized_address_display": "333 O'Farrell St Suite 400, San Francisco, CA 94102",
    "localized_area_display": "San Francisco, CA",
    "localized_multi_line_address_display": ["333 O'Farrell St", "Suite 400", "San Francisco, CA 94102"]
}
</code></pre>

Though address formatting varies considerably between different countries and
regions, Eventbrite still has a common address return format to keep things
consistent.

In general, you should treat `address_1`, `address_2`, `city`, and
`region` as opaque lines of the address printed in that order. The
`postal_code` field contains the local postal or zip code equivalent, if
available, and the `country` field contains the `ISO 3166 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1>`\_
country code for the country (with the name of the country broken out
for your convenience).

All fields apart from `address_1` and `country` are optional.

#### Address Fields

| Field                                  | Type      | Description                                                                                                                 |

### Object

<pre><code>{
    "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/3564383166/",
    "id": "3564383166",
}
</code></pre>

The standard base representation for first-class objects in Eventbrite, such
as :format:`event`, :format:`venue` and :format:`order`.

The `resource_uri` is an absolute URL to the API endpoint that will return
you the canonical representation of the event, and the `id` is a
:format:`string` that represents a unique identifer for the event (note
that it is not necessarily numeric).

Other fields on objects are defined on their individual pages, but note that
fields may not be present if their value is `null`; we have noted fields
that may not contain a value with `(optional)`.

# Group Event Description

<a name="event_description"></a>
## Event Description

Event Descriptions have two representations:

1. A fully-rendered HTML version of the event description, and
2. A "raw" version of the description that is broken up into its distinct modules.


|         Field         |                 Type               |                          Description                           |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `page_version_number` | `string`                           | The number representing the current version of the description |
| `modules`             | `array[Structured Content Module]` | The list of Modules                                            |


### Structured Content Modules

Event descriptions are comprised of one or more modules, and there are two currently-supported module types: `text` and `image`.
Each module type will contain type-specific `data`.

|  Field  |    Type   |                                                                                                                                                                                                        Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :------ | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `type`  | `string`  | Module type. We currently support `text` and `image` types, but this list will change as more module types are added. Clients should be prepared to handle modules types they don't know how to render. In this case, clients may refuse to render the edit interface for these modules, but they should at a minimum store the data associated with these types and send it back to the server when sending edits of known types. |
| `data`  | `object`  | The module data specific for this module type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

# Group Ticket Class

<a name="ticket_class_object"></a>
## Ticket Class Object
The Ticket Class object represents a possible ticket class (i.e. ticket type) for an [Event](#event_object).

Typically, multiple different types of tickets for an Event can be purchased in one transaction. These ticket types do not necessarily map directly to the one [Attendee](#attendee_object) per one ticket model (instead for example, an Attendee might buy multiple tickets for different days of an [Event Series](#event_series_object)).

Ticket Classes can be one of the following types:
* **Free.** Ticket Classes that have no cost or currency. An Event with only free Ticket Classes is a free Event and doesn't require payout information.
* **Paid.** Ticket Classes with an associated cost in the Event's currency. Currency is specified in the Event object and is duplicated in the Ticket Class object as the return value of a `currency type`.
* **Donation.** Order owner is prompted to enter at their own discretion an amount to donate during checkout. There is no fixed cost of donation.

Ticket Class price can be communicated in a way that either includes Eventbrite fees in the total displayed price or shows fees split out as a separate cost from the total ticket price. The [User](#user_object) determines how costs are communicated.

Ticket Class responses for Events not owned by the [Organization](#organization_object) only shows cost and fees, as displayed on the Ticket Listing page. Results from Events the Organization owns also includes information on the `actual_cost` and `actual_fee`, which identify the amount of the ticket that the Organization is paid (actual_cost) and the Eventbrite fee deducted from the total charged amount (actual_fee).

Ticket Classes can be grouped using the [Ticket Group](#ticket_group_object) object, most commonly to apply a [Cross-Event Discount](#discount_object) to multiple Ticket Classes.

#### Public Fields
Use these fields to specify information about a Ticket Class. For publically listed Events, this Ticket Class information can be viewed by all [Users](#user_object) and Eventbrite applications.

# Group Attendee

<a name="attendee_object"></a>
## Attendee Object
The Attendee object represents the details of Attendee (ticket holder to an [Event](#event_object)). The model is one Attendee per each sold ticket.

If the Event is specified to only collect information on the [Order](#order_object) owner (the default), all returned Attendees have the same information, apart from the barcodes and [Ticket Class](#ticket_class_object) ID.

Attendee objects are considered private; meaning that all Attendee information is only available to the [User](#user_object) and Order owner.

# Group Discount

<a name="discount_object"></a>
## Discount Object
The Discount object represents a discount that an Order owner can use when purchasing tickets to an [Event](#event_object).

A Discount can be used to a single [Ticket Class](#ticket_class_object) or across multiple Ticket Classes for multiple Events simultaneously (known as a cross event Discount). 

There are four types of Discounts:

+ **Public Discount.** Publically displays Discount to Order owner on the Event Listing and Checkout pages. Only used with a single Event.
+ **Coded Discount.** Requires Order owner to use a secret code to access the Discount.
+ **Access Code.** Requires Order owner to use a secret code to access hidden tickets. Hidden tickets do not have a Discount. 
+ **Hold Discount.** Allows Order owner to apply or unlock Discount for seats on hold.

The display price of a ticket is calculated as: \
`price_before_discount` - `discount_amount` = `display_price`

Notes:
* Public and Coded Discounts can specify either an amount off or a percentage off, but not both types discounts.
* Access Codes cannot have either an amount off or percentage off.
* Public Discounts should not contain apostrophes or non-alphanumeric characters (except “-”, “_”, ” ”, “(”, ”)”, “/”, and “”).
* Coded Discounts and Access Codes should not contain spaces, apostrophes or non-alphanumeric characters (except “-”, “_”, “(”, ”)”, “/”, and “”).

## Pricing Object

## Items [/pricing-items/]

Depending on the scope type, the scope identifier has different meanings:
For scope.type ``organization`` scope.identifier represents an organization id.
For scope.type ``event`` scope.identifier represents an event id.
For scope.type ``ticket_class`` scope.identifier represents a ticket class id.
For scope.type ``assortment_plan`` scope.identifier can take a value of either 'package1' or 'package2'

Returns a `item_pricing` according to the provided base price and scope.
